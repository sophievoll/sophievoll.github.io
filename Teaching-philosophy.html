                                My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that every student has unique potential and deserves a supportive, engaging learning environment. I aspire to create a classroom atmosphere that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity. By integrating hands-on activities and real-world applications into lessons. I am committed to continuous improvement and reflection to better meet the needs of my students and adapt to their evolving educational journeys. I hope to inspire all students to create and showcase their individual ideas and solutions.

                            <p>
                                I am studying to become a teacher as I hope to make a positive impact on the lives of young people. During my own time at school, I was privledged to have a Design and Technology teacher who inspired me and motivated me, so much so that I have continued to become a teacher much like her. I have a love for design and innovation and I hope to pass that passion down to future generations. I have always been inspired by the power of education and the role teachers play in shaping the future. The opportunity to support and guide students as they discover their strengths and interests motivates me to pursue a career in teaching. I believe that by fostering a nurturing and dynamic learning environment, I can contribute to the development of well-rounded, confident individuals who are prepared to tackle the challenges of the future.
